# stzGraph: The Art of Connected Thinking

## The Beauty of Graphs

A **graph** is an elegant yet profound concept in computer science—a structure of **nodes** (entities) and **edges** (relationships) that illuminates how systems connect, interact, and evolve. Whether modeling **workflows**, **codebases**, **data schemas**, or **conversational logic**, `stzGraph` transforms intricate dependencies into intuitive understanding. With syntax that mirrors human reasoning, it makes relationships not just visible but **explorable and actionable**—directly from your terminal.

`stzGraph` transcends being a mere tool; it's a paradigm for **systems thinking**, where flows of influence, chains of causality, and cycles of interdependence become transparent and navigable. Its lightweight, dependency-free design combined with powerful analytical capabilities makes it a universal foundation for reasoning about any relational system.

---

## Quick Start: From Vision to Reality

Build, visualize, query, and annotate a graph in moments:

```ring
oGraph = new stzGraph("MyFlow")
oGraph {
    AddNode(:@start, "Start")
    AddNode(:@middle, "Process")
    AddNode(:@end, "End")
    
    AddEdge(:@start, :@middle, "flows")
    AddEdge(:@middle, :@end, "completes")
    
    Show()
}
```

Output:

```
        ╭───────╮        
        │ Start │        
        ╰───────╯        
            |            
          flows          
            |            
            v            
      ╭───────────╮      
      │ !Process! │      
      ╰───────────╯      
            |            
        completes        
            |            
            v            
         ╭─────╮         
         │ End │         
         ╰─────╯
```

Visualize horizontally with `ShowH()`:

```
╭───────╮          ╭───────────╮              ╭─────╮
│ Start │--flows-->│ !Process! │--completes-->│ End │
╰───────╯          ╰───────────╯              ╰─────╯
```

Query with precision:

```ring
? oGraph.NodeCount()                #--> 3
? oGraph.PathExists(:@start, :@end) #--> TRUE
```

Enrich nodes with contextual metadata:

```ring
oGraph.AddNodeXT(:@middle, "Process", [
    :priority = "high",
    :owner = "team-a"
])
```

`stzGraph` feels like a dialogue with your system—declare relationships, receive insights. No boilerplate, no dependencies, just **connected reasoning**.

## A Natural API: Code That Mirrors Intuition

The `stzGraph` API is architected to align with how you naturally think about systems. Every method answers a direct question:

| Your Question             | Method                                          | Returns             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Can A reach B?            | `PathExists(:@a, :@b)`                          | TRUE / FALSE        |
| What are all paths from A to B? | `FindAllPaths(:@a, :@b)`                  | Array of paths      |
| Are there loops?          | `CyclicDependencies()`                          | TRUE / FALSE        |
| What does X influence?    | `ReachableFrom(:@x)`                            | Array of nodes      |
| Which nodes are critical? | `BottleneckNodes()`                             | Array of IDs        |
| How connected is the graph? | `NodeDensity()`                               | % (0–100)           |
| What's the longest chain? | `LongestPath()`                                 | Edge count          |
| What connects to X?       | `NeighborsOf(:@x)`                              | Array of nodes      |
| What leads to X?          | `IncomingTo(:@x)`                               | Array of nodes      |
| Describe the graph        | `Explain()`                                     | Structured analysis |
| Does this exist?          | `NodeExists(:@id)` / `EdgeExists(:@from, :@to)` | TRUE / FALSE        |
| Show vertical view        | `Show()` / `ShowV()`                            | ASCII diagram       |
| Show horizontal view      | `ShowH()` / `ShowHorizontal()`                  | ASCII diagram       |
| Show with annotations     | `ShowWithLegend()`                              | ASCII + legend      |

The API speaks your language—thoughts translate to code with zero friction.

## Connectivity: Mapping the Possible

Every system tells a story. `stzGraph` reveals whether critical outcomes are reachable:

```ring
oWorkflow = new stzGraph("ApprovalProcess")
oWorkflow {
    AddNode(:@request, "Request")
    AddNode(:@manager, "Manager")
    AddNode(:@approved, "Approved")
    
    AddEdge(:@request, :@manager, "submit")
    AddEdge(:@manager, :@approved, "finalize")
    
    Show()
}
```

Output:

```
       ╭─────────╮       
       │ Request │       
       ╰─────────╯       
            |            
         submit          
            |            
            v            
      ╭───────────╮      
      │ !Manager! │      
      ╰───────────╯      
            |            
        finalize         
            |            
            v            
      ╭──────────╮       
      │ Approved │       
      ╰──────────╯  
```

Query with confidence:

```ring
? oWorkflow.PathExists(:@request, :@approved)  #--> TRUE
```

## Alternative Routes: Exploring Complexity

Real systems rarely follow a single path. `stzGraph` exposes every possibility:

```ring
oProcess = new stzGraph("MultiPathProcess")
oProcess {
    AddNode(:@start, "Start")
    AddNode(:@fast, "Fast Path")
    AddNode(:@standard, "Standard Path")
    AddNode(:@end, "Complete")
    
    AddEdge(:@start, :@fast, "expedited")
    AddEdge(:@start, :@standard, "normal")
    AddEdge(:@fast, :@end, "finish")
    AddEdge(:@standard, :@end, "finish")
    
    Show()
}
```

Output (branches clearly demarcated):

```
        ╭───────╮        
        │ Start │        
        ╰───────╯        
            |            
        expedited        
            |            
            v            
      ╭───────────╮      
      │ Fast Path │      
      ╰───────────╯      
            |            
         finish          
            |            
            v            
      ╭──────────╮       
      │ Complete │       
      ╰──────────╯       

          ////

        ╭───────╮  ↑
        │ Start │──╯
        ╰───────╯        
            |            
         normal          
            |            
            v            
    ╭───────────────╮    
    │ Standard Path │    
    ╰───────────────╯    
            |            
         finish          
            |            
            v            
      ╭──────────╮       
      │ Complete │       
      ╰──────────╯       
```

Quantify the complexity:

```ring
aPaths = oProcess.FindAllPaths(:@start, :@end)
? len(aPaths)  #--> 2
```

## Parallel Execution: Unlocking Concurrency

Identify branches that execute independently to optimize workflows:

```ring
? oProcess.ParallelizableBranches()  #--> [[:@fast, :@standard]]
? oProcess.DependencyFreeNodes()    #--> [:@start]
```

This intelligence empowers architects to unlock parallelism—from concurrent task scheduling to modular microservice design.

## Cyclic Dependencies: Visualizing Feedback Loops

Cycles aren't errors; they're feedback systems. `stzGraph` reveals their structure with clarity:

```ring
oCyclic = new stzGraph("CyclicStructure")
oCyclic {
    AddNode(:@p1, "P1")
    AddNode(:@p2, "P2")
    AddNode(:@p3, "P3")
    
    AddEdge(:@p1, :@p2, "")
    AddEdge(:@p2, :@p3, "")
    AddEdge(:@p3, :@p1, "")
    
    Show()
}
```

Output (cycle highlighted with precision):

```
         ╭────╮          
         │ P1 │          
         ╰────╯          
            |            
            v            
         ╭────╮          
         │ P2 │          
         ╰────╯          
            |            
            v            
         ╭────╮          
         │ P3 │          
         ╰────╯          
            |            
      <CYCLE: >   
            |           ↑
            ╰──> [P1] ──╯
```

Programmatic detection:

```ring
? oCyclic.CyclicDependencies()  #--> TRUE
```

## Structural Constraints: Enforcing Integrity

Embed design rules directly into your model to prevent structural flaws:

```ring
oGraph = new stzGraph("DAGStructure")
oGraph {
    AddNode(:@a, "A")
    AddNode(:@b, "B")
    AddNode(:@c, "C")
    
    AddConstraint("ACYCLIC")
    AddConstraint("CONNECTED")
    
    AddCustomConstraint("NO_ORPHANS", func {
        return len(This.DependencyFreeNodes()) = 1
    })
    
    AddEdge(:@a, :@b, "")
    AddEdge(:@b, :@c, "")
}

? oGraph.ValidateConstraints()  #--> TRUE
```

Built-in constraints like `ACYCLIC` and `CONNECTED`, combined with custom rules (e.g., `NO_ORPHANS`), enforce your design intentions early, catching violations before they propagate.

## Reachability: Measuring Influence

Identify nodes that disproportionately influence system behavior:

```ring
oHierarchy = new stzGraph("TypeSystem")
oHierarchy {
    AddNode(:@entity, "Entity")
    AddNode(:@person, "Person")
    AddNode(:@employee, "Employee")
    AddNode(:@manager, "Manager")
    
    AddEdge(:@entity, :@person, "is_a")
    AddEdge(:@person, :@employee, "is_a")
    AddEdge(:@employee, :@manager, "is_a")
    
    Show()
}
```

Output:

```
       ╭────────╮        
       │ Entity │        
       ╰────────╯        
            |            
          is_a           
            |            
            v            
      ╭──────────╮       
      │ !Person! │       
      ╰──────────╯       
            |            
          is_a           
            |            
            v            
     ╭────────────╮      
     │ !Employee! │      
     ╰────────────╯      
            |            
          is_a           
            |            
            v            
       ╭─────────╮       
       │ Manager │       
       ╰─────────╯  
```

Extract insights:

```ring
? oHierarchy.ReachableFrom(:@person)  #--> [:@person, :@employee, :@manager]
? oHierarchy.Explain()
```

Output:

```
Graph: TypeSystem
Nodes: 4 | Edges: 3
Bottleneck nodes: @person, @employee
No cycles - DAG
Density: 25% | Longest path: 3 hops
```

## Bottlenecks: Locating Critical Convergence

Spot nodes where multiple paths converge—often the weakest link in system resilience:

```ring
oGraph = new stzGraph("BottleneckTest")
oGraph {
    AddNode(:@a, "A")
    AddNode(:@b, "B")
    AddNode(:@c, "C")
    AddNode(:@hub, "Hub")
    
    AddEdge(:@a, :@hub, "")
    AddEdge(:@b, :@hub, "")
    AddEdge(:@c, :@hub, "")
    
    ShowWithLegend()
}
```

The `!Hub!` marker signals a critical convergence point. Query it:

```ring
? oGraph.BottleneckNodes()  #--> [:@hub]
```

## Impact Analysis: Quantifying Risk Propagation

Model how failures cascade through dependencies—essential for resilience planning:

```ring
oSystem = new stzGraph("SystemDependencies")
oSystem {
    AddNode(:@database, "Database")
    AddNode(:@api, "API")
    AddNode(:@worker1, "Worker1")
    AddNode(:@worker2, "Worker2")
    
    AddEdge(:@database, :@api, "")
    AddEdge(:@api, :@worker1, "")
    AddEdge(:@api, :@worker2, "")
}

? oSystem.ImpactOf(:@api)       #--> 2
? oSystem.FailureScope(:@api)   #--> [:@worker1, :@worker2]
? oSystem.MostCriticalNodes(2)  #--> [:@api, :@database]
```

## Complexity Metrics: Assessing Architectural Health

Quantify coupling and latency risk through system-wide metrics:

```ring
? oGraph.NodeDensity()  #--> % (0–100, tight vs. modular)
? oGraph.LongestPath()  #--> Edge count (latency indicator)
```

High density reveals tight coupling; lengthy paths suggest latency bottlenecks. Use these signals to guide refactoring decisions.

## Direct Dependencies: Granular Visibility

While global queries reveal system-wide patterns, local inspection provides essential precision. `stzGraph` exposes immediate neighbors—both outgoing (what this node influences) and incoming (what depends on it)—without traversing the entire graph. This granular view is invaluable for microservice isolation, module boundary verification, or root-cause analysis during incidents.

```ring
oGraph = new stzGraph("Services")
oGraph {
    AddNode(:@api, "API")
    AddNode(:@auth, "Auth")
    AddNode(:@db, "DB")
    
    AddEdge(:@api, :@auth, "")
    AddEdge(:@api, :@db, "")
}

? oGraph.NeighborsOf(:@api)  #--> [:@auth, :@db]
? oGraph.IncomingTo(:@auth)  #--> [:@api]
```

These queries answer: "What does API directly touch?" and "What depends directly on Auth?"—questions that scale better than full reachability analysis for operational troubleshooting or design review.

## Rich Querying: Domain-Aware Discovery

Annotate nodes with metadata, then query contextually for domain-specific insights:

```ring
oGraph = new stzGraph("Codebase")
oGraph {
    AddNodeXT(:@fn1, "function1", [:type = "function"])
    AddNodeXT(:@fn2, "function2", [:type = "function"])
    AddNodeXT(:@mod1, "module1", [:type = "module"])
    
    AddEdge(:@fn1, :@fn2, "calls")
    AddEdge(:@fn2, :@mod1, "imports")
}

? oGraph.Query([:nodeType = "function"])  #--> [:@fn1, :@fn2]
? oGraph.FindNodesWhere(func node {
    return substr(node["label"], "function") > 0
})  #--> [:@fn1, :@fn2]
```

Metadata transforms your graph into a semantic model, enabling precise queries tailored to your domain.

## Inference: Extensible Reasoning Engines

`stzGraph` moves beyond static relationship recording to become a dynamic reasoning engine. Built-in inference rules (`TRANSITIVITY`, `SYMMETRY`, `COMPOSITION`) handle common patterns, but the true power emerges through **custom inference logic**—where you encode domain-specific reasoning as executable rules.

Consider organizational hierarchy: explicit edges capture direct reporting relationships, but organizational reality demands understanding chains of command. Rather than manually computing transitive closure, you register an inference rule once, and the graph continuously applies it to new data. This transforms static models into **self-evolving systems**.

Anonymous functions (deferred code blocks) enable this paradigm—you pass logic to the graph system, which executes it when needed, not when defined. The rule operates on current graph state and injects derived knowledge back, creating a feedback loop of insight.

```ring
oGraph = new stzGraph("Organization")
oGraph {
    AddNode(:@alice, "Alice")
    AddNode(:@bob, "Bob")
    AddNode(:@carol, "Carol")
    AddNode(:@david, "David")
    
    AddEdge(:@alice, :@bob, "manages")
    AddEdge(:@bob, :@carol, "manages")
    AddEdge(:@carol, :@david, "manages")
    
    RegisterInferenceRule("CHAIN_OF_COMMAND", func oGraph {
        nInferred = 0
        acEdges = oGraph.AllEdges()
        acNewEdges = []
        
        # Nested loop: for each pair of edges, check if one's "to" matches the other's "from"
        nLen = len(acEdges)
        for i = 1 to nLen
            aEdge1 = acEdges[i]
            cMidpoint = aEdge1["to"]  # End point of first edge
            
            for j = 1 to nLen
                aEdge2 = acEdges[j]
                # Found a transitive pair: A -> B -> C means A can reach C
                if aEdge2["from"] = cMidpoint
                    cFrom = aEdge1["from"]
                    cTo = aEdge2["to"]
                    
                    # Avoid duplicates: only add if edge doesn't already exist
                    if NOT oGraph.EdgeExists(cFrom, cTo)
                        if find(acNewEdges, [cFrom, cTo]) = 0
                            acNewEdges + [cFrom, cTo]
                            nInferred += 1
                        ok
                    ok
                ok
            end
        end
        
        # Add all inferred edges to the graph
        nNewLen = len(acNewEdges)
        for i = 1 to nNewLen
            aNewEdge = acNewEdges[i]
            oGraph.AddEdge(aNewEdge[1], aNewEdge[2], "(chain-inferred)")
        end
        
        return nInferred
    })
    
    ? ApplyCustomInference("CHAIN_OF_COMMAND")  #--> 3 new relationships inferred
    ? EdgeExists(:@alice, :@carol)             #--> TRUE (now discoverable)
    ? CustomInferenceRules()                   #--> ["CHAIN_OF_COMMAND"]
}
```

The rule automatically surfaces hidden authority—Alice now provably manages Carol and David, even though no explicit edge existed. **Three inferred edges emerge from two inputs**: the graph becomes a reasoning substrate, not a passive map. Extend with domain logic; let the system derive consequences. This pattern scales to regulatory compliance (transitive obligation chains), supply chains (implicit dependencies), and codebase analysis (inferred coupling through composition).

## Temporal Evolution: Versioning Change

Capture graph states at key moments for auditing, comparison, or rollback:

```ring
oGraph = new stzGraph("DatabaseSchema")
oGraph {
    AddNode(:@users, "users")
    AddNode(:@orders, "orders")
    AddEdge(:@users, :@orders, "has_many")
    
    Snapshot("v1.0")
    
    AddNode(:@payments, "payments")
    AddEdge(:@orders, :@payments, "has_many")
    
    ? Snapshots()  #--> ["v1.0"]
}
```

Snapshots enable safe exploration—revisit or compare states as your system evolves.

## Export and Interoperability: Building Resilient Systems Through Extensibility

Static formats suffocate complex systems. `stzGraph` solves this through **pluggable exporters**—a mechanism to serialize your graph into any format, on-demand, for any ecosystem. Standard formats (DOT, JSON, YAML) handle common needs, but the extensibility model empowers you to encode domain-specific knowledge into serialization itself.

Imagine integrating with visualization tools, compliance audits, or CI/CD pipelines—each demands different representations of the same underlying graph. Rather than maintaining parallel models or writing ad-hoc conversion scripts, you register exporters once, then invoke them dynamically. The graph becomes a **unified source of truth** that speaks every language.

Anonymous functions make this elegant: pass transformation logic to the graph system, which applies it to current state and returns the result. New tools, new formats, new requirements—extend without touching core logic.

```ring

Register an exporter in the morning, paste output into [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live) by afternoon, deploy interactive documentation by evening—no backend changes, no format wrestling. A single `stzGraph` instance now powers visualization, documentation, auditing, and system validation across teams. This is **extensibility as resilience**: when requirements shift, your foundation adapts, not fractures.

## Visualization: ASCII as Strategic Clarity

You've encountered rich graphs throughout this document. Here's why we **chose ASCII over sophisticated rendering**: pragmatism over eye candy.

Sophisticated diagrams seduce—but they seduce *after* the work is done. In the moment of design and discovery, you need **thinking speed**, not presentation polish. ASCII visualization enforces abstraction: no colors to distract, no fonts to fuss over, no layout engines to configure. You see structure naked—nodes, edges, patterns—without the cognitive load of graphic rendering.

More importantly, ASCII visualization is **instant and embedded**. Your terminal. Your REPL. Your notebook. No external tools, no context-switching, no waiting for GraphQL rendering (stzDiagram provides that power for publication; we chose ASCII for *thinking*). This proximity collapses the design cycle: modify your graph, hit Enter, see consequence immediately. Rapid prototyping becomes a natural rhythm.

**Layout Modes** serve specific analytical lenses:

- **Vertical (`Show()` / `ShowV()`)** — Hierarchical flows cascade top-to-bottom, mirroring causal reasoning. Workflows, dependency chains, inheritance hierarchies—sequence-driven thinking.

- **Horizontal (`ShowH()` / `ShowHorizontal()`)** — Parallel branches spread left-to-right. Compare alternatives, reveal concurrent paths, spot symmetric structures at a glance.

- **Annotated (`ShowWithLegend()`)** — Semantic markers overlay structural analysis: `!bottleneck!` flags convergence zones, `~cycle~` highlights feedback, `////` partitions branches. What queries would surface, visualization makes immediate.

**Markers encode system properties**:
- `!label!` — bottleneck (multiple paths converge)
- `~label~` — cycle participant
- `!~label~!` — cyclic bottleneck (compound risk)
- `<CYCLE: label>` — feedback loop marker
- `[Node]` — cycle member
- `////` — branch boundary

ASCII transforms `stzGraph` from a data structure into a **thinking partner**—tactile, responsive, uncluttered. When clarity matters more than pixels, constraints become features.

## Foundation for Domain-Specific Reasoning

`stzGraph` serves as the **architectural foundation** for specialized abstractions built atop graph semantics:

- **stzWorkflow** — task dependencies and orchestration
- **stzDecisionTree** — branching logic and outcomes
- **stzSemanticModel** — concept relationships and meaning
- **stzDataModel** — schema cardinality and constraints
- **stzCodeModel** — module and function dependencies
- **stzNaturalLanguage** — semantic role networks

Each inherits `stzGraph`'s analytical power while introducing domain-specific vocabulary. **Graph structure is universal; semantics are domain-specific.**

## Softanza Advantage

`stzGraph` elevates relationships from implementation details to first-class language constructs—concise, visual, and analytically rich. It's a developer-first tool for systems reasoning without the overhead of heavy frameworks or proprietary lock-in.
