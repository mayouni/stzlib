# String narration-audit — defects found (real code/test bugs)

Running log of genuine defects surfaced while narrating (= correctness-auditing)
`base/test/string`. Triangulated against the recovered archive
`stzStringTest.ring` (from git `f6bdfbcc^`, the pre-split monolith). Each entry:
what's wrong, evidence, and the fix decision (code vs test, per defect policy).

## Open — code bugs (need a fix in the implementation)

- **`ReplaceInSections(old, new, sections)` is broken** (test 04_findzz).
  `Q("Programming for programmers").ReplaceInSections("m","M",[[1,11],[17,27]])`
  should give `"PrograMMing for prograMMers"` but returns **`" for "`** — both
  sections are destroyed, only the gap survives. The narrative-order arg-swap is
  correct; the bug is in the per-section replace loop (stzString.ring ~8492).
  `ReplaceInSection` (singular, test 03) works fine, so compare the two.

## Open — semantics to confirm (test #--> vs current impl disagree)

- **`SizeInBytes()` / `SizeInBytes64()` / `SizeInBytes32()`** (test 06_sizeinbytes).
  `"Softanza"` → current `8 / 548 / 348`; archive `#-->` says `624 / 624 / 400`.
  `SizeInBytes()=8` (content byte length) looks like the correct modern meaning;
  the old `#-->` appear to measure object memory footprint. Decide the intended
  semantics for all three, then fix whichever side is wrong.

## Resolved

- **`12_containseither`**: archive + modular both said `#--> FALSE` for a string
  containing BOTH words; the impl is an INCLUSIVE or (TRUE) and the separate
  `ContainsOnlyOneOfThese` is the exclusive form. Original test author was wrong
  → corrected the assertion to TRUE (commit 2ef2f86a).
