/*
This code demonstrates how to implement a plugin system in Ring
using the feature of embedding Ring within Ring.

The code contains two classes: BaseString and ExtendedString.

The BaseString class provides basic string methods, such as size() and upp().

The purpose of the plugin system is to allow users to write custom methods
in separate files, stored in the plugins subfolder.

The system reads each plugin file, executes it in a separate Ring state,
and integrates the functions found in the plugin file as part of the
ExtendedString class.

To invoke the extended function, the programmer uses the Xf() method,
passing the name of the plugin function and the required parameters.

Here is an example of the content of a plugin file:

	#< ring_pluging_file #>
	
	@plugin_desc   = "Plugin for replacing a substring by an other in a given string"
	@plugin_name   = "plugin_string_replace"
	
	@plugin_value  = "Hello Ring in Ring!"
	@plugin_param  = [ "Hello", "Embedding" ]
	
	@plugin_result = pluginFunc(@plugin_value, @plugin_param)
	#--> Embedding Ring in Ring!
	
	func pluginFunc(value, aParams)
		cResult = ring_substr2(value, aParams[1], aParams[2])
		return cResult

The programmer should only give a name to the file with the format:
	{"plugin_string_" + @MethodName }

And then implement the function in the file by changing its body.

	# As you see, Xf() functions always return a value, even if the
	# meaning of the function is an action. This is noraml, because
	# the plugin-based functions run in an isolate Ring state. And
	# hence it can noot make any action (side-effect) on the
	# objects (and variables) on the main program.

	# To make the update, you just add the U suffix to the bame of the Xf() function.

	# Let's check the base object content first (you will notice that none of the
	# xfunctions we called above has changed its initial value)

	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#

	# A diffence worh noting here, between updating things in Softanza using
	# normal update functions and plugin-based functions (XfU()), is that the
	# first just makes the update and returns nothing, but the XfU() makes tries
	# to make the update and returns 1 or 0, depending whethe the update
	# has neen successful or not.

	# This is normal because the first happens in a managed environment, but the
	# second happens in an external plugin-ebvironmend involving unmaneged fatures
	# like reading and closing files (made by the operation system).

	# To Chek it, write this to get TRUE:

	? o1.XfU(:replace = [ "Hello", "Embedding" ])
	#--> TRUE

	# In this case, the XFunction has been executed and the
	# main object has been succefully replaced

	? o1.Content() + NL
	#--> Embedding Ring in Ring!

	# Or write this and get 0:

	? o1.XfU(:doStaff) + NL

	# Hence you are able to opt for a protective-style to check
	# plugin-based functions in a conditional code like this:

	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#

	#TODO Add this feature

	# Timed Plugin-Fuctions
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	# To restric a plugin-function to a maximum of 3 seconds, we add TM() suffix:

	//? o1.XfTM(:reverse = "...FIRST PART... Other art of the string ...", 0.01)
	#--> ...TRAP TSRIF... Other part of the string ...

	# As you see, the reversing stops at the "... FIRST PART..." of  the string
	# when 3 sconds have elapsed. The remaining part is returned as-is.

	#--> only the part of size 120 bytes is reversed, the rest is returned as-is.

*/
	# Looped Plugin-Fuctions
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	# If the inner code خب the plugin function is based on a main loop, you can
	# constraint it to run only a given number of iterations using the L() suffix.
	# (we metaphorically say that the function LOOPED, analogous to the TIMED and
	# SIZED namings used above):
/*
	? o1.XfL(:reverse, "... a large string ...", 99)
	#--> only the first 99 chars are reversed, the rest of the string are returned as-is?

	# Fault-tolerant Timed, Sized, and Looped Plugin-functions
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	# To raise errors in a fault-tolerant way so the main program receives
	# the errors but continues execution of the next actions, use the Xff()
	# form of the calling function:
/*
	? o1.XffTMX(:reverse, " ... large string 1 ...")
	? o1.XffSZX(:reverse, " ... large string 2 ...")
	? o1.XffLX(:reverse, " ... large string 3...")

	# If we suppose that only the second call is erroneous, we get:

	#--> "... large string 1 reversed in part depending on the time contsraint..."
	#--> Error: Can't run the plugin-function! Maximum size exceeded.
	#--> "... large string 3 reversed in part depending on the number of loops..."

	# This leads to robust code, especially when running multiple calls in a list
	# calls (using Xf([ xf1, xf2, ... ])  or when calling them concurrently (using
	# Xf() with the C() suffix).

	# Added Value of TIMED, SIZED, and LOOPED calls
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	# 1. When used consciously, these features can prevent runaway processes,
	#    memory bloat, or CPU hogging, which is especially valuable in shared
	#    or resource-constrained environments.

	# 2. Developers can fine-tune the behavior of plugins without modifying
	#    the plugin code itself, which is extremely powerful for system
	#    administrators and DevOps teams.

	# 3. These features can be used as built-in profiling tools, helping
	#    developers identify and optimize slow or resource-intensive operations.

	# 4. When running multiple calls concurrently, these constraints can
	#    prevent any single operation from monopolizing system resources.

	# 5. The system becomes more resilient to poorly optimized or
	#    potentially malicious plugins.

	# 6. The system can adapt to different execution environments by
	#    adjusting these constraints.

	# 7. Improved programming and debugging experience.

	# Plugins states can be paused and then resumed.

	# By pausing states, we can free up system resources for other processes.

	# or persisit our pluging data (or workflows involving multiple plugins

	# This allows us to free the system from these processes and resume

	#   DELAGATING MAIN CONTROL FLOW TO A LIST OF CALLED PLUGINS   #
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#

	#TODO Add this feature

	# Traditionally, after calling a plugin function, the control flow returns
	# to the main program to determine the next function to execute. This can
	# be inefficient.

	# A better approach is to delegate this responsibility to the plugins themselves.

	# Each plugin can specify the next plugin to call after finishing its work. This
	# eliminates the need for the main program to handele each call individually,
	# improving performance and memory usage.
	
	# How it Works?
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	# We achieve this in Softanza, simply, by providing the Xf() function with
	# a list of plugins instead of just one. Each plugin in the list is called
	# sequentially by the previous one, streamlining the execution flow.
	
	# Example
	
	// Calling multiple plugins in one go

//	o1.Xf([:removeNonLetters, :Replace = ["Embedding", "Hello"], :reverse])
	#--> !gniRnigniRolleR

	# Here, the main program makes a single Xf() call with an array of three
	# plugins. Each plugin calls the next one in the list, resulting in the
	# final output without unnecessary back-and-forth with the main program.
	
	# Traditional Approach (Less Efficient)
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	# For comparison, the traditional approach involves separate calls for each plugin:

	# Example
/*
	o1.XfU(:removeNonLetters)
	o1.XfU(:Replace = ["Embedding", "Hello"])
	o1.Xf(:reverse)
*/
	# This method requires multiple interactions with the main program, leading to
	# decreased performance.
	
	# Benefits of Delegated Control Flow
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	# ~> Improved performance: Calling plugins sequentially eliminates unnecessary overhead.
	# ~> Efficient memory usage: Streamlined execution reduces memory usage.
	# ~> Cleaner code: Main program handles fewer individual calls, leading to more concise code.

	#   DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT OF THE RING LIBS (TO BE) LOADED BY THE PLUGINS  #
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#
	
	#TODO Add this feature

	# Softanza's plugin system includes a lightweight dependency management feature
	# for Ring libraries loaded by plugins.

	# This system allows for verificationof plugin dependencies without compromising
	# the isolation of each plugin's execution environment.
		
	# The main program can then check these (to be loaded) libraries:
/*	
	? XLoadedLibs(:plugin-name)
	#--> [ "stzlib.ring", "mathlib.ring", "statslib.ring" ]
	
	# Before executing the plugin, the programmer can verify if all required
	# libraries are availabel (accessible by the code running in the plgin-file):
	
	if XLoadedLibsAvailable(:plugin-name)
		output = Xf(:plugin-name)
	else
		raise("Can't run the plugin file! Some loaded libs are not available.")
	ok

	# Leading to a more robust and stable code.

	#   PLUGIN VERSIONING AND COMPATIBILITY   #
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#

	# Plugin versioning is a crucial feature for managing the evolution
	# of plugins over time. It allows us to track changes, ensure
	# compatibility, and manage updates effectively.

	# Let's see how Softanza Plugging System allows them.

	# Setting and checking plugin versions
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/*
	# Plugin versions are defined by an incremental number at the end of
	# the plugin file name), and can be checked using XVersion():

	? XVersion(:reverse_V1) # Or XCurrentVersion()
	#--> V1

	? XVersions(:reverse)
	#--> [ V1, V2, V3 ]

	? XLastVersion(:reverse)
	#--> V3

	XSetActiveVersion(:reverse, :V2)

	? XVersion(:reverse)
	#--> V2

	? HasVersion(:reverse, :V5)
	#--> FALSE
*/
	# Defining the compatible plugins versions with the main program
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/*
	# Declared in the global variable:

	_aXCompatiblePlugins = [
		:reverse = [ :V3, :V2 ],
		:removeNonLetters = [ :V5 ],
		:otherPluggin = [ :V1 ]
	]

	# We get this information using:
	? XCompatiblePlugins()

	# We can check a plugin compatible versions by:
	? XCompatibleVersions(:reverse)
	#--> [ :V3, :V2 ]

	# We can chek if a given version of a plugin is compatible with
	# the main program by:

	? XIsCompatible(:reverse, :V2)
	#--> TRUE

	# This enable writing a robust code like this:

	if XIsCompatible(:reverse, :V1)
		? XfV(:reverse, "Hello World!", :V1) # Note the use of V() suffix for Version
	else
		raise("Can't proceed. Plugin version is not compatible with the main program.")
	ok

	# Add makes it possible to run a plugin in any of its compatible versions

	for version in XCompatibleVersions(:reverse)
		? "Output of version " + version + ": "
		see XfV(:reverse, "أهلا بالعالم !", version)
	next
	#--> Output of version V2 : ! �ل٧ع؄٧ب� �؄ه٣�
	#--> Output of version V3 : ! ملاعلاب الهأ

	# As you see, it's clear that V3 added the support of Unicode  chars (arabic here)
	# in the reverse plugging function.

	# You can check it in the metatdata of the XVersions() function along with the XT suffix:

	? XVersionsXT(:reverse)
	#--> [ :V1 = "Basic version", :V2 = "Better performance", :V3 = "Unicode support" ]

	#NOTE
	# Those meta data are read for @plugin_description variable in the header of the plugin file.
*/
	# Updating a plugin to its last version
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/*
	XUpdate(:reverse)

	# Which can also be achieved by:

	XSetActiveVersion(:reverse, XLastVersion(:reverse))

	#NOTE
	# By convention, plusing ages is defined by the number figuring in its
	# version number. Hence, V3 versions is newer then V2 version, V2 version
	# is newer then V1 version, and vice versa.
*/
	# Dependencies management on plugins versions
	#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	#NOTE
	# Dependency management features we showed earlier apply to plugins versions
	# since they are just different plugin files.
